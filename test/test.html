    <p>
      This is a quick test document for helping out with figuring out how well
      featurette works. It's super simple, so I'm expecting it to work fairly well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="#" class="featurette" data-featurette="see-more" data-target="#more">Read More</a>
    </p>

    <p id="more" style="display: none;">
      That's right. Featurette works really well with creating unobtrusive javascript
      features in your page.
    </p>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="featurette.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="test.js"></script>
  </body>
